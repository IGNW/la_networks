# Files for Daylite CUCM Integration

## Overview
This folder contains 4 example files to answer questions posed to IGNW by the customer.

- `jabber-call-state.html` Shows how javascript in a Custom Tab can be used to provide call state to the jabber client
- `jabber-click-to-dial.html` An example of SIP and TEL URL's for testing click to dial from web pages.  This works with Firefox, but Chrome has a pop up each time
